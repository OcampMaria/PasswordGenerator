# Personalized Password Generator
<p> 
The Password Generanator application's code was already created and styled, but the application was not totally functioning. JavaScript code was used to generate a random strong password with specific criteria chosen by the user to provide greater security. Criteria for the password can include letters, numbers, and special characters. 
</p>

<p>
Visual Studio Code was used to add JavaScript code to finish the application. HTML and CSS files were used for the entire application to function. Once the code was completed the application was published using Github Pages. 
</p>

<p>
When completing this application, some of the challenges that appeared included, having minimmum understanding of JavaScript. I found functions, and objects to be the most challenging. I neded to spend extra time figuring out how the functions work and where to place the correct code. After I had a better understanding of how JavaScript works I was able to finish the application. 
</p>

<p>
By working on this application, I learned basic JavaScript fucntions. As always there can be different ways to approach the code. I wrote code that I was able to better understand. 
Moreover, I learned that with a little of persistance, I am able to get through the challenges and obstacles. 
</p>
